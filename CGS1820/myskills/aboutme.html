				<h1><span class="head1">A</span>bout <span class="head1">M</span>e</h1>
				<p>	<span class="newp">M</span>y name is Oliver, I am a computer science major at PHSC. What a lot of people do not know about me is my art. I've made this website to sort of showcase my artwork. It's not a very expected activity for a computer science major, but I've been doing artwork my entire life, it was only recently that I decided I also had a love for coding. I figure, being a hobbyist GameDev would be an interesting way to bring my own artwork to life. I've always wondered what it would look like if I could make my paintings breathe--really. If they could tell a story, what would they say? Who are they outside of surrealist paintings? These questions are the ones I want to answer for myself, direct the narritive for my characters, my paintings.</p>

I hope to gain the skills needed to either be a data-base analyst, software engineer, or a freelance coder. I also want to use these skills to code my own games on the side, yanno, for funzies. </p>
