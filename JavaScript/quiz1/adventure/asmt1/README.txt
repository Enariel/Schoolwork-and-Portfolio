JavaScript Instructions:

Definitions:
a. The "guest" is the end-user

1. Create an external, JavaScript file and use the file to create all functions and variables. Do not embed any JavaScript statements, variables, or functions within the HTML file.

2. When a guest selects an adventure, use a JavaScript function to display information about that specific adventure below the image. Do this for each image (3).

3. Create a function that estimates the cost for each adventure. 

    3a. Once additional information about the adventure is displayed on the webpage, use another JavaScript function to provide an estimated cost to the guest. 

    3b. The estimated cost will be based upon the number of people within the guest's party. This number must be provided by the guest. 

    3c. This function should also include a minimum of three local variables that specify a single, line-item cost for the adventure, such as a ticket (30), gas (10), food (10), parking (10), bait (10), umbrella (20), chairs (20), cooler (10), ice (2), etc. 

4. Include comments to note the purpose of each variable and each function. Comment liberally throughout your JavaScript file.

5. Use your own, unique names for variables and functions. Do NOT use variable and function names from the book or hands-on class exercises. Exceptions to this rule include 'total' and 'result'.

6. Do NOT post any of these instructions on ANY developer Q&A community board. Doing so will result in a zero grade. 

7. This is an individual assignment. Working with another student on this assignment will result in a zero grade.
