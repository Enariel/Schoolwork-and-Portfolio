Objective:
Once an end user completes the form on the index.html file and clicks the "Submit Ticket" button, the (currently hidden) section element should appear on the right with the user's information and a description of the user's issue. See enclosed image file for an example.

Note that the section element and nested div elements are hidden via CSS.

HTML Home Page File Instructions:

1. Update the Comment with your name, the file name, and date.

2. Update the title element with your last name.

3. Open the home page in your web browser to view the page.

4. You are welcome to change the form content. Note that, if you do, you may need to update some of form attributes (id and for) the style rules in the CSS file.

5. The HTML file includes several comments throughout the page with additional information.

6. You may add more HTML elements and attributes to the webpage as you see fit.

CSS File Instructions:

1. Update the comment with your name, the file name, and date.

2. You may modify style rules as desired.

----------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript Instructions:

1. Create an external, JavaScript file and use the file to create all functions, variables, and JavaScript statements. Do not embed any JavaScript statements, variables, or functions within the HTML file.

2. Use JavaScript to store the user's information within a variable array or JavaScript object.

3. Use JavaScript to loop through the variable array or JavaScript object 
and display the client's name, department, office location, email, and 
phone number within the first div element (ticketFor id) within the 
section element. The user information should be placed within paragraph elements. (Hint: See Chapter 10, Show Hidden Content for more information about how to display content hidden by CSS.)

4. Use JavaScript to display the client's description of the issue within the second div element (ticketDesc id) within the section element. The user's description of the issue should be placed within a paragraph element. 

5. The hidden section and two div elements should appear with the user's information once the user click's the "Submit Ticket" button.

6. Include comments to note the purpose of each variable and each function. Comment liberally throughout your JavaScript file.

7. Use your own, unique names for variables and functions. Do NOT use variable and function names from the book or hands-on class exercises. Exceptions to this rule include 'result'.

8. Do NOT post any of these instructions on ANY developer Q&A community board. Doing so will result in a zero grade. 

9. This is an individual assignment. Working with another student on this assignment will result in a zero grade.

10. 50pt BONUS Opportunity:
If the user did not complete one or more form fields, use the empty, errorMessage div element on the page to display a message to the user to complete all fields before submitting the ticket.
